# Predictive-Control
Some scripts connected with predictive control of two-dimensional neutralisation reactor. Scripts were written
for my master thesis purposes.
## Master thesis title: NONLINEAR MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL OF MULTIVARIABLE PROCESS USING A NEURAL WIENER STRUCTURE
Scripts covers:
* reactor modelling,
* creating data sets for training and validation purposes
* predictive control of the model using MPC-NO, MPC-NPSL and GPC algorithms
* algorithms comparison
